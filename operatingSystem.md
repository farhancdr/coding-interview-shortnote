# Operating System
## Process
- A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.

## Thread
- A thread is a unit of CPU utilization. It is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.

## Context switching
- Context switching is the process of saving the state of a process or thread that is being preempted so that it can be restored and execution can resume from the exact same point at a later time.

## Deadlock
- A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

## Concurrence vs Parallelism
- Concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.
- Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
