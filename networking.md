# Computer Network

## PORT
- PORT: A port is a communication endpoint. It is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.
 
## OSI model
- Application layer: end devices
- Presentation layer: data format. encryption and compression
- Session layer: session management
- Transport layer: end-to-end communication. TCP and UDP
- Network layer: forwarding packets and routing.
- Data link layer: error detection and correction. 
- Physical layer: physical transmission


## TCP vs UDP
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, while UDP is a connectionless protocol.
- TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.
- UDP provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
- Ex: TCP is used for HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and UDP is used for DNS, DHCP, and TFTP.

## HTTP vs HTTPS
- HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer data over the web. HTTPS is HTTP over TLS/SSL.

## OSI vs TCP/IP
- OSI is a reference model for networking, while TCP/IP is a set of protocols that implement the model.

## Handshake
- A handshake is a sequence of messages exchanged between two or more computing devices, or between a computer and a user, in order to set up a direct connection between the devices and establish the parameters of the connection.
