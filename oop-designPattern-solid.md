# OOP
## OOP principles
- Encapsulation: The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
- Abstraction: The process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
- Inheritance: The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.
- Polymorphism: The provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.

## SOLID
- Single responsibility principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- Open-closed principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov substitution principle: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- Interface segregation principle:  keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
- Dependency inversion principle:  classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

## Design patterns
### Creational patterns
- Abstract factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder: Separates object construction from its representation.
- Factory method: Creates an instance of several derived classes.
- Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
- Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist.

### Structural patterns
- Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes.
- Bridge: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation.
- Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects.
- Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
- Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing.
- Proxy: An object representing another object.
  
### Behavioral patterns
- Chain of responsibility: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
- Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object.
- Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program.
- Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
